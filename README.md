## GitDiffParser
 `GitDiffParser` is a Python tool for analyzing file-level differences between two commits in a GitHub repository. It automatically clones the repository, compares file versions between the specified commits, and outputs diffs for each changed file.

---

### ðŸš€ Features

- Clone any public GitHub repository (temporary or persistent).
- Show which files changed between two commits.
- View the diff content of each changed file.
- Load full file content from both the current and previous commits.

---

### ðŸ§° Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- Git must be installed and available in your system's PATH

---

### ðŸ“¦ Installation

No installation needed. Just clone this repository and run the script directly:
### Add .env
* Add .env under `RegressionTest` folder
* Edit .env file and add GEMINI_API_KEY into it
```
GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY
```
### API
* init: clone the target repo
* get_changed_files: list the files which have been changed
* load_file: return the source code of the target commit
* load_file_from_previous_commit: return the source code of the base commit
* get_diff: return the git diff result between target and base commit
#### Easy way to call api
1. Inital the class with correct parameters
2. use get_changed_files to get the name list of modified files
3. load_file and load_file_from_previous_commit to load the specific function in the output of get_changed_files
4. use the both output of load_file and load_file_from_previous_commit as an input of ast_analyzer to analyze different
### Usage
```bash
python ./RegressionTest/diff_parser.py <repo_url> [--from COMMIT] [--to COMMIT] [--keep] 
```

#### Options

- `--from`: Base commit (default: `HEAD^`)
- `--to`: Target commit (default: `HEAD`)
- `--keep`: Keep the cloned repo (default: repo is deleted after diff)

#### Examples

```bash
python ./RegressionTest/diff_parser.py https://github.com/CoverIQ/CoverIQ-Test-Assistant

python ./RegressionTest/diff_parser.py https://github.com/CoverIQ/CoverIQ-Test-Assistant --from abc123 --to def456

python ./RegressionTest/diff_parser.py https://github.com/CoverIQ/CoverIQ-Test-Assistant --keep
```


#### Test run-test.yml on local
1. If you are using Windows, please install [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install) first  
**ensure that you are using an administrative shell to install chocolatey**   
2. Install act-cli
```
choco install act-cli
```
3. Comment the following lines in run-test.yml
```
env:
    GEMINI_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.GEMINI_API_KEY }}
```
4. Go to root directory and run the following command while opening docker 
```
act pull_request --env-file RegressionTest/.env --artifact-server-path ./artifacts
```
